Extract "Android.zip"

**Change Constants.java file**

- for localhost : type 'ipconfig or ifconfig'(based on linux/mac/windows)
get the 'ip' and your ROOT_URL will be like http://192.168.1.101/Android/v1/
where replace your 'ip' with 192.168.1.101. You have to put "Android" folder in htdocs

- for online database host
ROOT_URL will be like "http://yourwebsitename.com/Android/v1/"
here I have 000webhost website named testwebsite, just put "Android" folder in
public_html with "v1" and "includes" in it.
obviously change Database host,username and password.
